# State

## Current Objective
Maintain a custom fork of Telegram Web A (telegram-t) focused on a single "Main" folder, kept in sync with upstream, with Fetch media extraction and Windows-compatible production serving.

## Active Work
- Main-only mode live: chat navigation, folder UI, and notifications (foreground + service worker) restricted to the "Main" Telegram folder, fail-closed if it's missing
- Weekly automated upstream sync (`sync-upstream.yml`) merges Ajaxy/telegram-tt, validates (check+test+build), and pushes only on success
- No source commits since 2026-07-14 (bc9f1a6ce/9d63b6e4a, then the ca107f210 dist refresh); the fifty-eight commits since are all memory anchor-advances. Cadence: 2026-08-18 (09:11), 2026-08-18 (23:11), 2026-08-19 (09:15), then this run
- `serve.cjs` restarted six more times on 2026-08-19 afternoon/evening (last 18:24) - `logs/` now 536 files, newest pair `error-511`/`out-511`

## Blockers
None known

## Next Actions
- [ ] Fix the `CLAUDE.md` symlink corruption at the source - `strap map` appends the lookup hint with no symlink guard (`P:\software\_strap\modules\Commands\map.ps1:423`). It is a closed loop: committing memory triggers the re-index that re-breaks the link, so restoring here can never stick
- [ ] Commit or gitignore the untracked chinvex index (`docs/sys/lookup.json`, current as of 2026-08-19 09:15) - `AGENTS.md` tells agents to read it; it is regenerated on every commit
- [ ] Clean up stray untracked cruft: `logs/` (536 files), root file `8445`, `serve.js` duplicate, `.worktrees/loop-1783831370776-db43f9`
- [ ] Confirm the SW notification allowlist (`setAllowedNotificationChatIds`) is posted correctly from `ChatFolders.tsx` on folder changes
- [ ] Re-confirm Fetch extraction end-to-end through cloudflared tunnel post-Vite-migration

## Quick Reference
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build:production` (Vite; then `node serve.cjs` to serve)
- Test: `npm test` (Vitest)
- Entry point: `src/index.tsx`

## Out of Scope (for now)
- Tauri desktop build (scripts present but not active focus)
- Expo/React Native WebView wrapper (`app/`, untracked since 2026-04) loading https://interlink.unkndlabs.com
