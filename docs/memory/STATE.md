# State

## Current Objective
Maintain a custom fork of Telegram Web A (telegram-t) focused on a single "Main" folder, kept in sync with upstream, with Fetch media extraction and Windows-compatible production serving.

## Active Work
- Main-only mode live: chat navigation, folder UI, and notifications (foreground + service worker) restricted to the "Main" Telegram folder, fail-closed if it's missing
- Weekly automated upstream sync (`sync-upstream.yml`) merges Ajaxy/telegram-tt, validates (check+test+build), and pushes only on success
- No code changes since 2026-08-24 — the last ten commits are gitignore and memory updates
- `serve.cjs` owner unchanged: PID 47552 (started 2026-09-23 23:27:38) still listening on 8445 as process `interlink`, ~23.8h in — the post-burst hold is approaching the ~25-36h band
- `logs/` unchanged since the 2026-09-24 00:00:05 rotation: 725 files, 1,378,555 bytes, newest by mtime still the `out-128` pair. No genuine restart pair since 2026-09-19 02:27

## Blockers
None known

## Next Actions
- [ ] Fix the `CLAUDE.md` symlink corruption at the source - `strap map` appends the lookup hint with no symlink guard (`P:\software\_strap\modules\Commands\map.ps1:423`). It is a closed loop: committing memory triggers the re-index that re-breaks the link, so restoring here can never stick
- [ ] Investigate why `serve.cjs` restarts (15 on 2026-09-01, 13 on 2026-09-02, 4 on 2026-09-03, 2 on 2026-09-05, 2 on 2026-09-06, 4 on 2026-09-07, 3 on 2026-09-08, ≥1 unlogged 09-09..09-11, ≥2 on 2026-09-12, ≥1 unlogged by 09-13 04:18, ≥3 on 2026-09-14, ≥1 unlogged on 2026-09-15 17:53, 2 on 2026-09-19, ≥1 unlogged on 2026-09-20 23:47, ≥1 unlogged on 2026-09-21 16:14, ≥3 unlogged on 2026-09-23 at 08:33, 20:13 and 23:27) — every pair is zero-byte, so the trigger is outside the app
- [ ] Identify what rotates `logs/` at midnight — a rotator now moves file mtimes with no restart involved, so mtime is unreliable for restart detection in both directions
- [ ] Clean up stray untracked cruft: `logs/` (725 files), root file `8445`, `serve.js` duplicate, `.worktrees/loop-1783831370776-db43f9`
- [ ] Re-confirm Fetch extraction end-to-end through cloudflared tunnel post-Vite-migration

## Quick Reference
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build:production` (Vite; then `node serve.cjs` to serve)
- Test: `npm test` (Vitest)
- Entry point: `src/index.tsx`

## Out of Scope (for now)
- Tauri desktop build (scripts present but not active focus)
- Expo/React Native WebView wrapper (`app/`, untracked since 2026-04) loading https://interlink.unkndlabs.com
